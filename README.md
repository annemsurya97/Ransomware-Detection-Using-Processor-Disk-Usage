# Ransomware Attack Detection Through Processor and Disk Usage Data Analysis

This project detects ransomware attacks using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms by analyzing processor and disk usage data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `ransomware_data.csv`, which contains processor and disk usage metrics labeled as either **Benign** or **Ransomware**.

## Algorithms Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Deep Neural Network (DNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Required packages in `requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
